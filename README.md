# MyDictionary
Dictionary bot was created as a pet-project

Project was created for getting info about english words (definition, synonyms, examples, difficulty score)

Two APIs were used:  
-WordsAPI with methods (GET) that provide definitions, synonyms, and examples for an input word;  
-LanguageScoringApi with WordScore(GET) and TextScore (POST) methods to display input complexity on a 10-point scale
